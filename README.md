# Multi-label-emotion-classification
In this project I built to models that can extract emotions from a text or a picture of a face. 
```
face.ipynb
```
For face emotions detection I trained a CNN using pytorch from scratch and acheived 55% accuracy for 7 classes. 

```
text.ipynb
```
For text emotions detection I used the roberta pretrained model and I fine tuned it. More details are available in Jupiter notebooks.
